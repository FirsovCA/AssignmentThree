                <p><span>Welcome to the site about dark chocolate</span> - a delicacy that many consider to be the real "food of the gods". The history of dark chocolate goes back thousands of years, starting with the Aztecs, who were the first to discover a way to make a drink from roasted cocoa beans. However, the chocolate bars we are used to appeared later, in the 18th century, when they began to mix cocoa with milk.</p>
                <p>Today, dark chocolate is recognized not only as a tasty, but also a healthy product. Unlike milk and white chocolate, dark chocolate contains flavonoids - compounds that have a positive effect on the health of the heart and blood vessels, helping to regulate blood pressure, improve blood circulation and reduce the level of "bad" cholesterol. Regular consumption of this chocolate also reduces stress levels and protects the body from inflammatory processes.</p>
